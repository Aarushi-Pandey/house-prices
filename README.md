# house-prices
Currently open challenge in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques (link to the challenge)

The challenge is to predict house prices using advanced regression techniques (from the given data with around 80 features given in Kaggle).

The language I used for this challenge is R.

My best prediction was able to predict sale prices for the test data with error upto 14.404%.

I used feature engineering skills as well as popular models like svm (support-vector machines), glm (general linear model), decision tree(s), and random forests for these predictions.
