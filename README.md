# house-prices
Currently open challenge in Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques (link to the challenge)

Challenge is to predict house prices using advanced regression techniques (from the given data with around 80 features).

At my best I was able to predict prices for the test data with error upto 14.637

The language I used for this challenge is R.
I used feature engineering skills as well as models like svm, glm,dTree, and randomForest for these predictions.
